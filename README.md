This page was made to help prospective students find a online Biology degree based on their skill level. 
I used HTML5 and CSS to create this webpage. 
Althought creating the webpage went smoothly, I still ran into some issues with the page not being mobile-friendly and having trouble with the positioning of some elements. 
In the future, I would love to implement a feature that will list the top schools for Biology degrees before having to turn to the drop down menu. This will give the user a "sneak preview" of the schools they would want to look into.
